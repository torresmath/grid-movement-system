# grid-movement-system
I'm a big fan of games with grids so I decided to create this grid movement system inspired by crypt of the necrodancer (without the metronome mechanic) just for fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Here you have a party with three characters that move in line along the grid, and you can swap the party leader pressing TAB. The movements aren't totally polished and there's still some bugs involving the character swap, but the idea was to play around with the mechanic.

To build it, I used a Notification Pattern by TheLiquidFire(http://theliquidfire.com/2015/06/15/better-than-events/) and DOTween plugin to code the animations
